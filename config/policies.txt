Refund & Return/Exchange Policy

1. **Eligibility for Returns/Exchanges**
   - Fulfilled orders are eligible for exchange/returns **only if** the item was delivered dented or damaged and is returned within the stated timeframe.
   - Because our pieces are made to order, exchange/returns will **not** be processed for wrong size orders. Please confirm your size with our size guide before purchase, or email atuchewomanng@mail.com for assistance.
   - Items purchased, picked up, or fitted in-store are **not** eligible for returns, exchanges, or refunds. Please do an in-store check/fit.
   - Sales items or items purchased with a discount code **do not** qualify for returns or exchanges.
   - Exchange of items between the parent brand and sister brand is **not feasible**. However, we can merge delivery from both brands to avoid double delivery charges. For order merging requests, email atuchewomanng@gmail.com.
   - Unfulfilled orders are only eligible for exchange/cancellation **before end of day (EOD) of order purchase**.

     - **10 business days** from date of delivery for orders shipped outside Nigeria.
   - The item(s) **must physically be in our possession** within the above time frame to qualify for an exchange or refund. There are no exceptions to this rule.

3. **Charges**
   - The customer is responsible for the cost of sending the item(s) back to Atuchewoman.

4. **Refund Method**
