📌 Project Overview: Grace – WhatsApp Wholesale Assistant for AkanrabyAtuche
🎯 Project Goal
Grace is an intelligent, WhatsApp-based sales assistant designed to streamline and automate the wholesale sales process for AkanrabyAtuche, a fashion-forward brand specializing in vibrant prints and custom dresses. Built with Flask, Twilio, OpenAI GPT, and SQLite, Grace handles everything from initial customer engagement to fabric selection, payment confirmation, and order tracking—while maintaining a tone that blends professionalism with persuasive, brand-aligned humor.

🧠 Core Capabilities
Conversational Sales Assistant
Grace mimics a persuasive, deal-closing human assistant. She’s designed to reduce response delays and close sales efficiently.

Memory & Personalization
Grace uses an SQLite database to remember previous interactions, payment statuses, and customer preferences, enabling personalized experiences.

Fabric Selection Workflow
Grace requests dress images from customers, sends back available fabric print options from the catalog, and helps customers make selections.

Order Confirmation & Payment Requests
After a customer selects prints, Grace generates a summary with a 50% deposit request, provides payment instructions, and requests proof of payment.

Smart Payment Confirmation
Upon receiving a screenshot or notification of payment, Grace logs the confirmation and notifies the operations team to verify and proceed.

Humor-Driven Redirection
Grace politely (but humorously) redirects off-topic messages like trivia, flattery, or idle chats back to the goal: getting paid and moving products.

Let’s build her.


Great — now that we have a unified and detailed proposal for Grace, the next best step is to **move from planning to implementation** by starting with a focused **MVP build**. Here's how I recommend we proceed, broken into actionable phases:

---

### ✅ **PHASE 1: MVP FOUNDATION (2–3 Weeks)**

#### 1. **Select Stack & Set Up Repo**
- Choose your core stack from the proposal: `FastAPI` + `LangChain` + `GPT-4` + `Twilio API`
- Set up a GitHub repo with a basic service structure (multi-tenant-ready)
- Create a `.env` and config management system for loading tenant-specific data

#### 2. **Implement WhatsApp + GPT Chat**
- Connect Twilio's WhatsApp webhook to FastAPI
- Route incoming messages to a GPT-4 response engine
- Add fallback error handling and logging

#### 3. **Load Business Catalogs Dynamically**
- Allow JSON or CSV product catalog uploads (just mock files for now)
- Inject catalog context into GPT prompts using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

#### 4. **Add One Task Flow: Sales Funnel**
- Design a basic 3–5 step workflow:
  - Greeting → Product Inquiry → Price → Payment → Confirmation
- Use LangChain tools or flow controller to guide GPT response per stage

#### 5. **Test with AkanrabyAtuche**
- Load real product catalog
- Simulate or use real WhatsApp traffic
- Log all conversations for review

---

### 🔄 **PHASE 2: INTELLIGENCE + MEMORY (Week 4–5)**

#### 1. **Short-Term Context**
- Add memory management (use LangChain memory or custom Redis session tracking)
- Persist last 5–10 messages per user

#### 2. **Speech Library Sync**
- Auto-update your `speech_library.json` from fallback interactions
- Add a UI or script to reclassify intents periodically (for training/fine-tuning)

#### 3. **Knowledge Uploads**
- Add support for Notion/GSheet integrations or PDF parsing
- Extract structured Q&A to vector DB

---

### 📦 **PHASE 3: DASHBOARD + MULTI-TENANCY (Weeks 6–8)**

#### 1. **Admin Dashboard**
- Build a simple React or Streamlit-based UI:
  - Catalog upload
  - Tone customization
  - Business profile

#### 2. **Tenant Routing**
- Middleware that checks WhatsApp number and loads that tenant’s:
  - Knowledge base
  - Catalog
  - Memory
  - Flow config

#### 3. **Basic Analytics**
- Store interactions + intent hits
- Display response accuracy, drop-off, and sales conversions
