## Premium Multi-Business Support (Unified Customer Experience)

Grace is built to support entrepreneurs managing multiple brands or storefronts—**without exposing the complexity to the customer**.

### How It Works

- **One customer chat thread:**  
  Customers don’t need to know you own multiple businesses.

- **Behind the scenes:**  
  Grace intelligently maps customer requests to the appropriate brand (e.g. Atuche Woman vs. Glow Essentials) based on product mention, catalog availability, or your configured rules.

- **Unified tone:**  
  The assistant maintains a consistent brand voice across interactions.

- **No need for multiple bots or phone numbers:**  
  Everything runs through the same WhatsApp line and assistant identity.

#### Use Case Example

A customer messages:

> “Do you have any organic body butter in stock?”

Grace checks the product across all brands you manage and responds with the right catalog entry—even if it’s from a separate Shopify store or database configured for another business.

#### Who This Is For

- Owners managing multiple ecommerce brands
- Entrepreneurs selling different product lines under separate names
- Anyone who wants a single AI assistant across all their business channels

#### Why It’s Premium

This feature is only available on premium plans because it involves:
- Catalog aggregation
- Dynamic intent routing
- Brand-specific pricing, fulfillment logic, and tone control
